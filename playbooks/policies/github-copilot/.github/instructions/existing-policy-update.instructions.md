# Existing Policy Update

- Read the current policy and identify current allow and deny behavior.
- Identify the intended behavior change.
- Identify behavior that must not regress.
- Verify all input fields against documentation, schemas, sample input, or existing tests.
- Make the smallest focused change.
- Provide simulation cases for unchanged behavior, newly allowed behavior, and newly denied behavior.

Preserve the Caracal result contract and deny-by-default behavior.
