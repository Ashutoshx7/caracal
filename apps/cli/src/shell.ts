// `caracal`: thin top-level shell that owns stack lifecycle commands and dispatches cli/tui to their sibling binaries.
//
// Surface invariant: SHELL_COMMANDS in @caracalai/core/commands is the single source of truth for the six top-level commands (up, down, status, purge, cli, tui). buildRegistry enforces a 1:1 mapping with the executors below; any drift fails the build.
