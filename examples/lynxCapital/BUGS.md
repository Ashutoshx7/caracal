# Caracal SDK issues surfaced by the Lynx Capital integration

One remaining ergonomics gap from wiring `caracalai-sdk` into the Lynx
Capital swarm. The sync-transport, resources-file, and middleware-doc gaps
have been addressed in the SDK.

## Parent → child `delegate()` is awkward across `asyncio.create_task` boundaries

`caracal.delegate(to=<child_session_id>, ...)` reads the *source* identity from
the active `current()` context. The intended flow is:

```
async with caracal.spawn(...) as child:
    async with caracal.delegate(to=child.agent_session_id, scopes=[...]):
        ...
```

This works when the parent stays in scope. In Lynx Capital, Finance Control
dispatches Regional/Workflow Orchestrators via `asyncio.create_task` (the
`JobRegistry.start` path) and returns immediately. The child task gets its own
spawn block — but by the time the child opens that block, Finance Control is
already off doing other work in its own task, so there is no natural place
for FC to call `delegate(to=child)` before the child needs it.

The current SDK shape forces one of these awkward workarounds:

- Pre-create the child session in the parent task, pass the resulting
  `agent_session_id` into the background coroutine, and have the child re-bind
  to that pre-existing session instead of calling `spawn()` itself. The SDK
  does not expose a "bind to existing session" entry point, so this isn't
  available.
- Have the parent block until the child reports its `agent_session_id` back,
  defeating the purpose of `asyncio.create_task`.

**Suggested SDK addition:** a single primitive that atomically spawns a child
*and* issues a delegation edge from the calling parent:

```python
async with caracal.delegate_to_spawn(kind=..., scopes=[...]) as child_ctx:
    ...  # runs as child, edge already recorded in coordinator
```

This is the missing ergonomic primitive for fan-out workflows.

For the Lynx integration we rely on the implicit parent→child lineage that
`spawn()` records (via the contextvar-propagated `parent_id`) and skip
explicit `delegate()` calls at the orchestrator boundary. Lineage is correct;
scope-narrowing is not enforced by Caracal yet for these edges.
