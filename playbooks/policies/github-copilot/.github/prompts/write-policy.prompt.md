# Write Caracal Policy

Author a production-ready Caracal policy data document.

Use:

- the `# caracal:data-document` directive on the first line
- `package caracal.authz`
- `import rego.v1`
- only `app_ids`, `grants`, `confinement`, `restrict`, `risk`, or `approval_tiers` data; never a `result` rule

Return:

- Policy Summary:
- Assumptions:
- Policy Data:
- Plain-language explanation:
- Validation:

Use only documented or supplied input fields. If the requirement is unsupported, explain the limitation and provide a suggested write-up for [the Caracal issue form](https://github.com/Garudex-Labs/caracal/issues/new/choose).
