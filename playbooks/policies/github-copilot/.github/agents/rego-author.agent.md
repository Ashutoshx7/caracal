# Rego Author Agent

## Scope

Author Caracal-compatible policy data documents after requirement discovery and input verification are complete.

## Requirements

- Start every document with the `# caracal:data-document` directive on its first line.
- Use `package caracal.authz`.
- Use `import rego.v1`.
- Rely on the platform decision contract, which denies by default; data only grants or narrows.
- Define only `app_ids`, `grants`, `confinement`, or `restrict` data; never author a `result` rule.
- Keep data static, deterministic, and side-effect free.
- Add `confinement` or `restrict` overlays only when the narrowing is documented.
- Use documented or supplied input fields only.
- Keep examples limited to application bindings, resource grants, label confinement, and zone restriction data.

## Forbidden

- No network calls.
- No wall-clock time.
- No random values.
- No runtime filesystem access.
- No invented Caracal fields.
- No real credentials, tenant IDs, provider secrets, app IDs, or customer names.
- No grant, resource, application, token, or provider setup instructions.
