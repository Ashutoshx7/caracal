## Required
- Must use PostgreSQL 18 only.
- Must listen on port 5432 only.
- Must package migrations and `caracal-migrate` inside the Postgres image.

- Must store secrets only as ChaCha20 ciphertext in `secrets.ciphertext` with `nonce` and `dek_id` populated.
- Must use CamelCase role names (e.g., `caracalSts`).

## Forbidden
- Must not import or reference `caracalEnterprise/`.
- Must not edit a committed migration file in place; add a new numbered migration instead.
- Must not grant UPDATE or DELETE on `audit_events` to any role.
- Must not grant write on `policy_versions` to any role.
- Must not store plaintext credentials, tokens, or subject claims in any column.
